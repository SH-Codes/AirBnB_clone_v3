============================================

Initialization (__init__):

When an instance of the BaseModel class is created, it initializes several attributes:
id: A unique identifier generated using uuid4().
created_at: A timestamp representing the creation time of the instance, set to the current datetime using datetime.today().
updated_at: A timestamp representing the last update time of the instance, also set to the current datetime.
If any additional keyword arguments are passed during initialization (**kwargs), they are used to update the instance attributes accordingly.
If no keyword arguments are provided, the newly created instance is added to a storage mechanism through models.storage.new(self).
Saving Changes (save):

The save method updates the updated_at attribute of the instance with the current datetime.
It then triggers the storage mechanism (models.storage.save()) to save the changes made to the instance.
Converting to Dictionary (to_dict):

The to_dict method returns a dictionary representation of the BaseModel instance.
It includes all attributes of the instance, such as id, created_at, and updated_at, as well as any additional attributes provided during initialization.
Additionally, it includes the class name (__class__) to indicate the type of object being represented.
The timestamps (created_at and updated_at) are formatted as ISO 8601 strings for consistency.
String Representation (__str__):

The __str__ method provides a human-readable string representation of the BaseModel instance.
It includes the class name, the id attribute, and a dictionary representation of all instance attributes.


CONSOLE.PY
============================================

1. mports: The code imports necessary modules and classes from the models package, including storage module, BaseModel, User, State, City, Place, Amenity, and Review classes.

2. parse function: This function parses input arguments into a list. It uses regular expressions to identify curly braces and square brackets in the input string and splits the string accordingly.

3. HBNBCommand class: This class defines the command-line interpreter using the cmd.Cmd module.

Attributes:

*prompt: This attribute defines the command prompt displayed to the user.
__classes: This dictionary maps class names to their corresponding classes.

*Methods:

** emptyline:** This method defines the behavior when an empty line is entered. In this case, it does nothing.

** default:** This method is the default behavior for the cmd module when an input command is invalid. It tries to match the input command with predefined commands like 'all', 'show', 'destroy', 'count', or 'update'. If the command matches, it executes the corresponding method; otherwise, it prints an error message.

** do_quit:** This method handles the 'quit' command to exit the program.

**do_EOF:** This method handles the EOF (End-of-File) signal to exit the program.

**do_create:** This method creates a new instance of a specified class (BaseModel, User, State, etc.) and saves it to a JSON file.

**do_show:** This method displays the string representation of a specific instance based on the class name and ID.

**do_destroy:** This method deletes an instance based on the class name and ID.

**do_all:** This method displays the string representations of all instances of a given class or all instances if no class is specified.

**do_count:** This method counts the number of instances of a specified class.

**do_update:** This method updates the attributes of an instance based on the class name, ID, and attribute name-value pairs.

**Main Block:** If the script is executed directly, it creates an instance of the HBNBCommand class and enters the command loop, allowing users to interact with the command-line interface.

TEST_AMENITY.py
========================================

1. **TestAmenityInstantiation:** This class contains multiple test methods to verify the behavior of the Amenity class upon instantiation. It checks if instances are created correctly, if their attributes are of the expected types, and if attributes such as id, created_at, and updated_at are generated properly. It also checks whether additional attributes can be added and if instantiation with keyword arguments works as expected.

2. **TestAmenitySave:** This class tests the save method of the Amenity class. It ensures that the save method updates the updated_at attribute and that the object is properly stored in the storage system. It also verifies that calling save with an argument raises a TypeError.

3. **TestAmenityToDict:** This class tests the to_dict method of the Amenity class. It checks whether the method returns a dictionary with the expected keys and values, including id, created_at, updated_at, and __class__. It also verifies that additional attributes are included in the dictionary and that datetime attributes are converted to string format. Additionally, it checks if the method doesn't return the object's __dict__ directly and if calling to_dict with an argument raises a TypeError.

4. **The if __name__ == "__main__":** block at the end of the file ensures that the unit tests are executed when the script is run directly.

TEST_PLACE.py
========================================


**TestPlaceInstantiation Class:**

	- This class contains test methods to verify various aspects of the Place class instantiation.
	- Each test method checks things like whether a new instance of Place can be created, whether it is stored correctly in the storage system, and whether its attributes are of the correct type.

**TestPlaceSave Class:**

	- This class tests the saving functionality of the Place class.
	- It ensures that when an instance of Place is saved, its updated_at attribute is correctly updated, and that the data is stored in the storage system (in this case, a JSON file).

**TestPlaceToDict Class:**

	- This class tests the to_dict method of the Place class, which converts an instance of Place into a dictionary format.
	- It checks whether the dictionary returned contains the correct keys (id, created_at, updated_at, and __class__), whether additional attributes can be added and are included in the dictionary, and whether datetime attributes are converted to strings.

**setUp and tearDown Methods:**

	- These methods are used to set up and tear down resources needed for testing. setUp ensures that a backup of the storage file is created before any tests are run, while tearDown ensures that any changes made during the tests are reverted, so subsequent tests start with a clean state.

**if name == "main":**

	- This conditional block ensures that if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module), the unittest.main() function is called to run all the tests defined in the script.

=========================================



TEST_REVIEW.py
=========================================

**TestReviewInstantiation Class:**

	This class contains a series of test methods that verify various aspects of the Review class instantiation.
	Each test method checks things like whether a new instance of Review can be created, whether it is stored correctly in the storage system, whether its attributes are of the correct type, and whether attributes like place_id, user_id, and text are public class attributes.

**TestReviewSave Class:**

	This class tests the saving functionality of the Review class.
	It ensures that when an instance of Review is saved, its updated_at attribute is correctly updated and that the data is stored in the storage system (in this case, a JSON file).
